Learning Objectives:
    Learn how to use Node
    Learn how to use MongoDB
    Learn how to use Express
    Learn how to combine all of them into a working website

Challenges:
    I struggled a lot with the interesting pug syntax, for starters
    The tutorial made it hard to understand why everything did what, so I had to do extra research to try to understand how to complete
        the challenges in part 6

This tutorial did help me to understand how the different programs work together, as well as the fundamentals of Node. That means
    that any project I do in the future with Node I don't have to start from the beginning. It was also useful in helping me understand
    dependencies and how different parts of databases rely on each other, and how that affects the order of events that you can operate with.
